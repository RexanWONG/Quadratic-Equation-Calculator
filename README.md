# Quadratic-Equation-Calculator
Hello world.  Created by Rexan Wong with Java on April 3, 2022.  Started self - learning Java for a week.  Trying my best to make this clean in the spirit of clean code.  Everything will be printed onto the console   


This Java program will : 
1. Find the roots / x intercepts of the quadratic
2. Find the Axis of symmetry of the quadratic parabola
3. Find the vertex of the quadratic
4. Find the y intercept of the quadratic
